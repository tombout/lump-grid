# lump-grid

Some CSS grid classes, similar to those from famous [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## CSS Classes

This package provides almost the same <code>.row</code> and <code>.col</code> classes
as Bootstrap 4.

There is no <code>.container</code> class in this package as this is a wrapper class 
that is not necessarily needed for a grid. The <code>.row</code> itself is a 
[flex container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-container).

## Dependencies

Following kick-ass packages are used in this project:

* [sass-mq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-mq)
* [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
* [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass)
